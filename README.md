sage -- a framework and proxy for Achaea in Python
==================================================

## Description

Sage is a telnet client, telnet proxy, and application framework created specifically to make writing code for IRE's [Achaea](http://achaea.com) easier and more fun.

You might enjoy sage if:

* You'd prefer to write your system in an IDE or text editor instead of your MUD client.
* You like Python and want to take full advantage of the language's power.
* You want your system to be client agnostic.
* Mixing code inside XML makes your nose bleed.
* You enjoy modularity and like sharing your code with others.
* You are unique and would rather build your own system than use a pre-built one.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7+ (2.7.3 recommended) or PyPy 1.8+ (1.9 recommended)
- Unix-like operating system (OS X, Linux, BSD, etc...)
_Theoretically, sage should be able to run on Windows. However, I don't have any interest in Windows and can't offer any help. What I can offer you are my heartfelt sympathies._

## Installation
- Coming soon

## Support
