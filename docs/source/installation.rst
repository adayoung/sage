Installation
============

Sage works with CPython version 2.7 and greater, but it will not work (yet) with
Python 3 as Twisted (a dependency) hasn't fully supported it yet. Sage also
can be used with `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_.

It's also recommended to have `libyaml <http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML>`_
installed but not required.
