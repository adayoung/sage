Notes on Windows
================

Python supports Windows and therefor Sage should be able to run on it with
minor modifications. The reason why Windows isn't supported is because I don't
have any machines that run it. I'm also not interested in going to the effort.

I apologize for any frustration this causes, but I simply cannot guarantee
stability on a platform I don't have access to. If Sage ever does support
Windows, it will be because someone has contributed pull requests (see
:ref:`contributing`) or became a maintainer for it. That someone could be you.

That being said, if you are just determined to run Sage you might have some luck
with `Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com>`_. Good luck, and share what you know!
