Welcome to Sage's documentation. This documentation is divided into different
parts. I recommend you get started with :ref:`installation` and then head over
to the :ref:`quickstart`. After the quickstart, there are more detailed
:ref:`examples` that will show you how to create complete (albeit small)
applications with Sage. If you'd rather dive into the internals of Sage, check
out the :ref:`api` documentation.
