Sage Protocol
=============

This example app creates a websocket connection in Sage for connecting a browser to be used as a
client. Using websockets, you could create powerful and dynamic UIs for the game.

An extremely basic HTML5 client is provided in this example. This is intended only as a proof of
concept and not to be used as a daily driver.
